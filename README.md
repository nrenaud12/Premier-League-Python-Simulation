The purpose of this code was to answer the following question: How to take variables from a dictionary and evaluate them against each other?

Doing so, this code is able to take a numerous number of items in a dictionary and give a value to those items. When put in the context, being simulating a soccer season for the Premiere League, 20 teams are given an appropriate skill level. This level is compared to the other team's skill level. Based off this value, both teams have a probability of scoring a goal, up to 6 goals per team. I chose the value 6 because the probability of scoring more than 6 is very unlikely. I found that doing so I could keep going with the function I made, I could have 100s of teams. There is a function which simulates one game between two teams and another function which simulates that first function between each combination of the teams which each team playing one at home game and one away game. This allows for a total of 190 games simulated. From each game, different data is collected goals scored and goals conceded. From this the other code dictates the winner, points given for win, draw, or lose and keeps track of the goal difference. Doing this, it can sort a standing in order of most amount of points.
